# Carrefour Supermarket Data analysis

We'll get to see how we can apply unsurpervised learning algorithms in solving business case problems more specifically we will perform Feature selection,apply Dimensionality reduction, perform association analysis and able to advice management on the best combination methods for the products they stock. We will lastly look at anomally analysis and able to tell when possibility of fraud is happening.

We will have Four sections for this study as illustrated below:

### Part 1: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction

### a) Feature Selection

This section requires us to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervisedlearning methods. We will be required to perform our analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.



### b) Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing our dataset to a low dimensional dataset using thet-SNE algorithm or PCA. We will be required to perform our analysis and provide insightsgained from our analysis.

### Part 2: Association Rules

This section will require that we create association rules that will allow us to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. We are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, we will also be required to provide insights for our analysis.

### Part 3: Anomally Detection

We have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
## Understanding the Data Structure
